[May 5th 2012]
Recently found this code lying in on my old backup CD's.

Have got it compiling under cygwin and CentOS.

Will be updating this README in sometime once I've gotten back the manual/help files fir this project ready.

This code was written by me in 2001, so please ignore all the violent code style and irritating logic! :)

[Getting Dirty]
Clone the repo and run 'make' to build the executable 'aisp'


$ make

You should be able to build this under any Linux machine with gcc/g++ installed.

I was able to build it under cygwin too.

Once the build is succesfull and you get the executable 'aisp' (aisp.exe under cygwin)
Get a taste of the AISP language by executing the following

$ aisp ./samples/guess.ais -I ./samples/include

Check the ./samples/guess.ais for the script that was executed by the interpreter.

Why the ugly syntax of AISP? Don't Ask!
